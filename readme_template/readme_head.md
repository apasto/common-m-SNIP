# common-m-SNIP

Short, somewhat simple, .m functions that I am using across repositories and projects (hence *common*).
Most of the times these come from pieces of larger scripts or from (then-)embedded functions (hence *snippets*).

Since they reflect the original scope for which they were written for, there is a bit of a *geographic bias* in the contents.
This means that they mostly manage data on rectangularly sampled geographical grids, stored in arrays as meshgrids or with accompanying grid-vectors.
Whenever there is a reference to the term "map array", this is what is meant.

Nothing is particularly breathtaking, but they have already proved useful, and are generic enough that keeping them in a private repository (for yet-to-be-submitted code) would have been pointless.

## Prerequisites

There are no dependencies to additional toolboxes, not even to the Mapping Toolbox. Tested on MATLAB 2018a.

Should be OCTAVE-compatible, but this was not tested for.

## Installing

Add the repository folder (the one that this README is in) to your MATLABÂ® path.
The contents of './+SNIP' will be then available as a 'package directory'.

`SNIP.` must be prefixed to the called function.

Example:

```matlab
SNIP.function_name()
```

## List of scripts/functions

The contents of this list and of `SNIP.DispContents` are automatically updated after every commit is pushed, using Travis CI.
