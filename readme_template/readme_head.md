# common-m-SNIP

Short, somewhat simple, .m functions that I am using across repositories and projects (hence *common*).
Most of the times these come from pieces of larger scripts or from (then-)embedded functions (hence *snippets*).

## Prerequisites

There are no dependencies to additional toolboxes. Tested on MATLAB 2018a.

Should be OCTAVE-compatible, but this was not tested for.

## Installing

Add the repository folder (the one that this README is in) to your MATLABÂ® path.
The contents of './+SNIP' will be then available as a 'package directory'.

`SNIP.` must be prefixed to the called function.

Example:

```matlab
SNIP.function_name()
```

## List of scripts/functions

The contents of this list and of `SNIP.DispContents` are automatically updated after every commit is pushed, using Travis CI.
